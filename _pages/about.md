I'm a computational scientist with a prior background in mechanical engineering. During my time in academia, I have worked extensively in the domain of multiphase fluid dynamics, focusing on the complex flow physics of fluid fragmentation (droplets, sprays etc.) using both deterministic and stochastic modelling frameworks. 

I have significant experience in the development and numerical resolution of a variety of mathematical models (mainly coupled non-linear [PDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)), as well as their large-scale parallel implementation on supercomputing infrastructure. In recent years, I've had the opportunity to add stochastic processes and probabilistic modelling techniques to my scientific computing toolkit. 

In my current role as a research scientist/engineer within the industrial R&D setup of a global leader in materials manufacturing, I develop computational models that tackle several physics and engineering challenges at the heart of large-scale and cutting edge industrial manufacturing processes. This includes working at the intersection of a wide array topics such as fluid dynamics, heat & mass transfer, thermal radiation, optimization, perturbation theory, numerical methods, experiment design etc.
